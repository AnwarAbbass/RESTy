# RESTy

- create react page 
- As a user, I expect an easy to read and understand user interface so that I can use the application intuitively
- As a user, I want to enter the URL to a REST API and select the REST method to use to access it
- As a user, I want visual confirmation that my entries and selections are valid so that I have confidence the application will be able to fetch the API data that Iâ€™ve requested
